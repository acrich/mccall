a_opt_unemployed should match a_opt_employed for wages above the reservation wage.
for wages below that, a_opt_unemployed should be constant in wage, and increasing in assets
the increase in next period assets is decreasing - at low levels, we eat a lot of our savings. at high levels, we keep relatively most of it, but still eat away absolutely more.
with respect to current level assets, when unemployed, next level assets should always be lower (unless benefits are too high), so we're always below y=x.
when employed, a_opt_employed is higher in wage (and increasing), and higher in assets (but decreasing)
there is an equilibrium asset level for every wage, and households will only save up to it, or eat away savings until they reach it.
so next period assets are above y=x for small current period levels, and eventually they go below.
a_opt_employed shouldn't be directly affected by benefits.
