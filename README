This project simulates McCall (1970) with a CES utility function, separations, and savings.

It is based on the basic McCall model, as implemented in quantecon.org.

The McCall model implementation is at model.py.

A good starting point is to run lifetime.py, which generates some graphs and statistics from that model.

Cached results of previous model results are stored under the npy dir, so whenever changing model parameters, be sure to clear that directory.

The gen_validation_doc.py script generates a PDF with lots of nice graphs, at tex/validation.pdf.
To run it, first install the following (assuming Debian):
sudo apt-get install texlive-xetex texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-generic-recommended
