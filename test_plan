a higher c (unemployment benefits), means:
in times of unemployment, consumption grows, both because of the benefits themselves and because of lower savings.
in times of employment, savings should be lower, meaning consumption again grows.
reservation wage should rise with c. should it do so for every savings level? probably the effect should decrease in savings. as a result, average wage should increase, and wage disparity should decrease.

increased savings should make for smoother consumption. it also makes for higher consumption. the two things work together only if the increase in consumption decreases as savings increase.

there should be a reasonable relationship between the wage distribution and c.

let's rename c to z. c should be consumption.

the lower ism is, the lower the savings decisions should be.
the higher the probability of separations (alpha), the lower the relationship between ism and savings should be, because there's another savings motive.

accept_or_reject determines the reservation wage. for every savings level it gives a threshold of wage above which we move from reject to accept.
that's all the information that's conveyed there. we expect the reservation wage to increase with savings.
the reservation wage will increase in benefits.
it'll increase in beta.
it'll increase with the mean wage. it'll increase with the variation of the wage distribution because more risk is better in this model.

if we use a ces utility where we can control the relative/absolute risk aversion.
the higher the ARA, the lower the utility will be when we increase the either the wage variation or alpha.
higher ARA means we have less motivation to increase consumption, so we should save more.

measuring it the other way around, higher consumption means lower A(c). The higher the ARA, the higher the effect will be.
there should be an indirect effect of wages/savings/benefits on consumption and through that on A(c).

higher ARA means lower reservation wage.

our function should withhold DARA and consequently also prudence.
however, relative risk aversion need not be constant. all options are legitimate.
there's evidence that relative risk aversion is U shaped.

the wage grid should simply reflect the wage distribution, and have a high resolution.
playing with the min/max grid values is not advised.

relationship between wage distribution and assets grid should be derived from the results of the model.
so we start with a very big grid, and then see that we can maybe diminish it.

the assets grid is also sensitive to changes in T, in case there's no equilibrium and assets keep growing.

increasing minimal consumption should increase consumption (diminishing effect, maybe we should see a discontinuity at the minimal consumption threshold).
you'd think it'll diminish savings, but really only up to the minimal consumption level. after that, savings should increase because of the added risk.
increase in minimal consumption should raise the reservation wage.
in times of unemployment, increased minimal consumption means faster burn rate (churn), so it diminishes the gap in behavior between rich and poor.

minimal consumption should never be below the minimum wage... and minimum wage should probably not be zero, like it is in our model so far.
that way, poor unemployed can always accept the offer to be able to pay for the minimal consumption, so you get a higher probability that they'll end up with absolutely low wages.
however, as stated above, rich households will grow poor faster, so they'll end up with lower wages as well.
we can't anticipate which effect is stronger.
however, we can anticipate higher savings (but only for the part of wages after minimal consumption has been spent).
this higher saving rate is for both types of households, but we'll see it happen more for the rich because they'll have the higher wages.

ism should interact with ARA. if ism is higher (interest is higher), we'll take more risks in order to increase savings.
so the reservation wage should increase with ism, and higher ARA should make the effect smaller.

a_opt_unemployed should match a_opt_employed for wages above the reservation wage.
for wages below that, a_opt_unemployed should be constant in wage, and increasing in assets
the increase in next period assets is decreasing - at low levels, we eat a lot of our savings. at high levels, we keep relatively most of it, but still eat away absolutely more.
with respect to current level assets, when unemployed, next level assets should always be lower (unless benefits are too high), so we're always below y=x.
when employed, a_opt_employed is higher in wage (and increasing), and higher in assets (but decreasing)
there is an equilibrium asset level for every wage, and households will only save up to it, or eat away savings until they reach it.
so next period assets are above y=x for small current period levels, and eventually they go below.

a_opt_employed shouldn't be directly affected by benefits.
higher beta means a_opt_employed and a_opt_unemployed should both be higher.
higher alpha means times of employment I'd want to save more, so a_opt_employed should have a higher equilibrium. a_opt_unemployed should not be affected.

changes in mean wage make potential future unemployment less threatening, but increases the benefit from higher assets in the future.
so there are effects on a_opt_employed in both ways and we can't anticipate results.
changes in the mean wage should encourage unemployed to stay that way longer, so it should decrease asset burn rate, meaning a_opt_unemployed will be higher.

a mean preserving spread in wages would make unemployment more attractive, so savings in both employment and unemployment should be higher.

if a_opt_employed ever hits a_max, then we a bigger grid.

higher minimal consumption should decrease a_opt_employed when wage is low, and have no effect when wage is high.
it should increase churn when unemployed, so a_opt_unemployed may be lower for every asset level, but only when the wage is below the reservation wage.

higher minimal consumption should improve consumption smoothing for the first few unemployment periods, but worsen it for longer spells.

higher ism (consequently also interest), means both a_opt choices should be higher, unless you're unemployed and assets are low, in which case you don't care about interest.

the effect of ism on savings should increase in the level of assets, and in wages.

v and h should both increase in assets and in wages.
for every asset level (row), values of h and v above the reservation wage for that asset level should be the same.
below the reservation wage, h should be higher than v, and also constant on that part of the row.

sum(separations) should on average be αT.

a, u_t, consumption and realized_wage are results of decisions in a path over time.
they act differently than the direct results of solving the model.
essentially, we should see the following:
a increases when employment_spells is set, and decreases when it's not.
a should move together with realized_wage
a' and consumption should match a and realized_wage, at every period.
at higher a, consumption smoothing should happen more.
what we're really smoothing is not consumption but intertemporal utility, the value of v/h should be smooth over time, while u(c) may be different.
consumption should move with the realized_wage.
