higher beta means a_opt_employed and a_opt_unemployed should both be higher.
higher alpha means times of employment I'd want to save more, so a_opt_employed should have a higher equilibrium. a_opt_unemployed should not be affected.

changes in mean wage make potential future unemployment less threatening, but increases the benefit from higher assets in the future.
so there are effects on a_opt_employed in both ways and we can't anticipate results.
changes in the mean wage should encourage unemployed to stay that way longer, so it should decrease asset burn rate, meaning a_opt_unemployed will be higher.

a mean preserving spread in wages would make unemployment more attractive, so savings in both employment and unemployment should be higher.

if a_opt_employed ever hits a_max, then we a bigger grid.

higher ism (consequently also interest), means both a_opt choices should be higher, unless you're unemployed and assets are low, in which case you don't care about interest.

the effect of ism on savings should increase in the level of assets, and in wages.

v and h should both increase in assets and in wages.
for every asset level (row), values of h and v above the reservation wage for that asset level should be the same.
below the reservation wage, h should be higher than v, and also constant on that part of the row.

sum(separations) should on average be αT.

a, u_t, consumption and realized_wage are results of decisions in a path over time.
they act differently than the direct results of solving the model.
essentially, we should see the following:
a increases when employment_spells is set, and decreases when it's not.
a should move together with realized_wage
a' and consumption should match a and realized_wage, at every period.
at higher a, consumption smoothing should happen more.
what we're really smoothing is not consumption but intertemporal utility, the value of v/h should be smooth over time, while u(c) may be different.
consumption should move with the realized_wage.


there should be a reasonable relationship between the wage distribution and z.

the wage grid should simply reflect the wage distribution, and have a high resolution.
playing with the min/max grid values is not advised.

relationship between wage distribution and assets grid should be derived from the results of the model.
so we start with a very big grid, and then see that we can maybe diminish it.

the assets grid is also sensitive to changes in T, in case there's no equilibrium and assets keep growing.
