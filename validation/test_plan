sum(separations) should on average be αT.

if a_opt_employed ever hits a_max, then we a bigger grid.

there should be a reasonable relationship between the wage distribution and z.

the wage grid should simply reflect the wage distribution, and have a high resolution.
playing with the min/max grid values is not advised.

relationship between wage distribution and assets grid should be derived from the results of the model.
so we start with a very big grid, and then see that we can maybe diminish it.

the assets grid is also sensitive to changes in T, in case there's no equilibrium and assets keep growing.
